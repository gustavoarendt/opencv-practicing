# OpenCV Projects
This repository contains a collection of projects where I explored and tested computer vision concepts using the OpenCV library. Each project is organized into its respective folder.

#### Project List:

Folder: `/handtracker`
Description: Implements hands-free interaction with a notepad and drawing canvas using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Pynput.

##### Driver Fatigue Detection:

Folder: `/facerecognition`
Description: Detects signs of driver fatigue, focusing on blink analysis, utilizing facial landmarks with OpenCV and MediaPipe.
Feel free to explore each project folder for detailed implementations and instructions.

Note: More detailed info about each project are in readme.md for each folder.
